From all your figures, which one is the greatest one for interpreting your data?

I think for the first evaluation, histogram and line plot gives us the opportunity to become familliar with 
dataset. the more we go forward, the better understanding requires us to apply a more sophisticated plot.
therefore, scatterplot is the most useful one, because it gives better understanding of the project. 
For instance,I know from that I know that S2 has a liner relation with eachother. S5 and S2 also have kind of a
linear relation.moreover, S4 has a somewhat ordered distribution.
